# Some instructions are in caps for legibility, not to yell at you :-)
#
# * You have ONE HOUR for the assessment. Finish as much as you can.
# * If you have a laptop with Ruby installed, please use that in
#   preference to a workstation. Use a workstation if you don't have a
#   laptop.
# * DO NOT use the internet. The problems are easily Googleable; you
#   should be well prepared from the practice assessment.
# * When finished, please ZIP YOUR SOLUTIONS (.tar.gz or .zip; no
#   boutique formats, please) and EMAIL THEM TO YOUR MENTOR. Also CC
#   instructors@appacademy.io.
#
# * Run `rake` in the terminal to run the tests.
# * Instructions on the what to do are contained below.
#
# * ASK FOR HELP if you are unclear on what a problem asks, if you get
#   stuck, or if a you think a test is wrong and that your code should
#   pass.
# * Be an intelligent test taker; if you get really stuck, move on to
#   another exercise.
